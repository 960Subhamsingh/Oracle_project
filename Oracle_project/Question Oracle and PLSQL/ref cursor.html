       <h1> Ref cursor in plsql </h1>
<p>
In PL/SQL, a REF CURSOR is a pointer that allows you to retrieve multiple rows
 of data from a database query. It enables the passing of result sets between PL/SQL subprograms (procedures and functions) and is particularly useful for handling dynamic queries.

<p style="width:;">Key Concepts of REF CURSOR,<p></p>

Definition: A REF CURSOR is a cursor variable that points to the result set of a query. You can define it as either strongly typed or weakly typed.

Strongly Typed REF CURSOR: This is associated with a specific row type and is type-safe. The structure of the result set is known at compile time.

Weakly Typed REF CURSOR: This is not associated with a specific row type, allowing for more flexibility in the queries executed against it.

How to Use REF CURSOR in PL/SQL
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide with examples:

Step 1: Define the REF CURSOR Type
You can define REF CURSOR types in a PL/SQL block, package, or type definition.

Example:

plsql
Copy code
-- Strongly typed REF CURSOR
DECLARE
    TYPE emp_cursor_type IS REF CURSOR RETURN employees%ROWTYPE;
    
    -- Weakly typed REF CURSOR
    TYPE generic_cursor_type IS REF CURSOR;
END;
Step 2: Declare and Open a REF CURSOR
You can declare a cursor variable of the type you defined and open it with a SQL query.


<strong>Example:</strong>


DECLARE
    TYPE emp_cursor_type IS REF CURSOR RETURN employees%ROWTYPE;
    
    emp_cursor emp_cursor_type; -- Declare a cursor variable
    emp_record employees%ROWTYPE; -- Variable to hold fetched record
BEGIN
    -- Open the cursor with a specific query
    OPEN emp_cursor FOR SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;

    -- Fetch and process each record
    LOOP
        FETCH emp_cursor INTO emp_record;
        EXIT WHEN emp_cursor%NOTFOUND;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee: ' || emp_record.first_name || ' ' || emp_record.last_name);
    END LOOP;

    CLOSE emp_cursor; -- Close the cursor
END;
/
Step 3: Using Weakly Typed REF CURSOR
You can also use a weakly typed REF CURSOR, which is more flexible. You don't need to specify a row type when defining the cursor.

Example:

plsql
Copy code
DECLARE
    TYPE generic_cursor_type IS REF CURSOR;
    
    generic_cursor generic_cursor_type; -- Declare a weakly typed cursor variable
    v_employee_id NUMBER;
    v_first_name VARCHAR2(50);
    v_last_name VARCHAR2(50);
BEGIN
    -- Open the cursor with a specific query
    OPEN generic_cursor FOR SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name FROM employees;

    -- Fetch and process each record
    LOOP
        FETCH generic_cursor INTO v_employee_id, v_first_name, v_last_name;
        EXIT WHEN generic_cursor%NOTFOUND;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee ID: ' || v_employee_id || ', Name: ' || v_first_name || ' ' || v_last_name);
    END LOOP;

    CLOSE generic_cursor; -- Close the cursor
END;
/
Advantages of Using REF CURSOR
Dynamic SQL: REF CURSORs are particularly useful for dynamic SQL scenarios where the structure of the returned data may not be known at compile time.
Flexibility: They allow you to pass result sets around between procedures and functions, making it easier to manage complex data operations.
Summary
REF CURSOR: A powerful feature in PL/SQL for managing and processing result sets from SQL queries.
Strongly Typed vs. Weakly Typed: Choose strongly typed REF CURSORs for type safety and structure definition, or weakly typed REF CURSORs for flexibility with dynamic queries.
You can use these examples as a starting point to implement REF CURSORs in your PL/SQL applications.
